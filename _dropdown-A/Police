### **Volunteering in the Singapore Police Force**

Volunteers in the Singapore Police Force play a critical role in upholding the law, maintaining order and keeping the peace in Singapore.

Our volunteers commit themselves to being a Force for the Nation in their own capacities, whether they augment our Force as part of the Volunteer Special Constabulary, spread important messages through the work of the Crime Prevention Ambassadors or help in the community Neighbourhood Watch Zones.

Keeping Singapore safe and secure is our shared responsibility. Do you think you have what it takes? Look out for our available opportunities and join us today!
