## Home Team Connection 

The Home Team works closely with the community. The 41 Boards, Councils and Committees under the Ministry comprise more than 500 respected community leaders and individuals. Through their volunteer efforts, our members assist the Ministry in preserving safety and security, counseling and helping ex-offenders re-integrate into society. Our Boards, Councils and Committee members have enriched the Home Team with ideas and solutions. In the process, they have played vital roles in helping the Home Team achieve the vision of building a safe and secure best home for Singaporeans
